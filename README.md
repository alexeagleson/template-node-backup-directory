## How to Use

If you want to try it out first the follow the instructions below.  

If you want to create your own version of the app, begin in the [introduction](#introduction) section.

This app will work on both Mac/Linux (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell).

1. Clone the project from  [this repository](https://github.com/alexeagleson/template-node-backup-directory)
2. Run `npm install` from the project directory
3. Create a `.env` file in the root with the following structure:

```
SOURCE_DIR="example-source/"
DESTINATION_DIR="example-destination/"
CRON_STRING="* * * * * *"
WEBHOOK_ID="DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID"
```

Update `SOURCE_DIR` to be the directory you want to copy, and `DESTINATION_DIR` where you want to synchronize.  

Edit `CRON_STRING` to determine the schedule the copying occurs on.  If you are not familiar with cron strings use [this tool](https://crontab.guru/) to help you create one.  

The `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID` is optional.  If you don't use it it will not impact the app.  If you do use it you remove the `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/` portion of the webhook URLm the remainder is the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID`.

4. Run the app with `node backup.js`.  

If you plan to run it as a long-term background process you can use PM2 which is described in the [Running as a Background Process](#running-as-a-background-process) section.

## Introduction

Like many other people out there, I have quite a few assorted documents and photos that are rather important to me. Although I know I have at least one copy of these locally and I use Dropbox as cloud storage, I'll admit I don't meet the coveted [3-2-1 backup strategy](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) requirements.

Over the holiday I received a new 4TB hard drive and with it, a renewed interest in backing up my data (at least the important stuff like pictures of my kids and financial records; even in the worst case scenario I could probably replace my Star Trek TNG blu-ray rips).

So with that in mind, I decided to combine it with an exercise that dives a bit further than I usually go into the Node.js ecosystem.

This tutorial is the result of that exploration, and the result is a little tool for synchronizing backup copies of any directory on your machine. As a bonus we're going to configure it to support Linux, Mac and Windows.

Before we begin I will give a little warning that this is primarily meant as a learning experience and is **_absolutely not meant to be the best backup solution_**.  

If you're serious about remote storage then something like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/drive/) will get the job done for you. For local backups setting up a [RAID drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) will cover your ass better than this little backup app will.

That said, those options are a lot less **_fun_** so if you're willing to use this as a learning opportunity to practice your Node.js skills, and get some bonus scheduled backups out of it, I think you'll find this to be a really interesting tutorial.  

## What You Will Learn

* Common Linux tools like `rsync` (copying files locally and over SSH), `cron` (scheduling tasks on a specific interval) and `nohup` (run something as a background process that doesn't stop when the terminal session is ended)

* Running Node (Javascript) apps as background processes, including automatic reboot on crash using `pm2`, a production viable tool for Node.js servers.

* More about the different values available on the `process` object in Node.js including `title` and `platform`

* Create an app that behaves differently depending on which OS it's running on and works on both Bash (Mac/Linux) and Microsoft PowerShell (Windows)

* Send messages to a webhook with HTTP POST requests, in our example that webhook will be a Discord bot

## Configuring Your Machine (Optional)

_(Note: if you already have a machine and folders that you want to use for your backups setup, then you can skip this step entirely.  All we are going to cover in this section is setting up Ubuntu Linux on an old laptop, configuring it to run 24/7, and using SSH so that we can access and manage it remotely from other machines on our home network)_

I'll be using this little blue Dell Inspiron with a whopping 2GB of RAM sitting around collecting dust.  

![Dell Inspiron](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/r_20/v1640738978/blogs/node-backup/dell-blue_si4qwq.jpg)

Honestly it's a great machine with an SSD inside of it, unfortunately it's just too bottlenecked by its 2GB of RAM, and there is no way to upgrade it (I've tried).  

So for that reason I haven't been able to get much use out of it, but that changes now.  

I began by following [this tutorial for installing Ubuntu with a USB stick](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview) and got the little laptop up and running with the latest Ubuntu.

Next I needed to make sure I could access the laptop from the terminal on my main machine.  That will be done over SSH so I followed [this tutorial on enabling SSH on Ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04/).  Afterwards I confirmed I could successfully SSH into the laptop from my machine.

Next I need to make sure that both `git` and `node` are installed on the machine, so that I can clone my project and run it.  Fortunately `git` comes by default with Ubuntu and I can installed `node` with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

If this gives you any trouble just [follow this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04).

Next I plug in my external hard drives that I am going to be using as backups.  When I create my app I'll be pointing from one directory on one hard drive to another directory on the other hard drive to sync each week.

Lastly I need to do a bit of housekeeping for the laptop to make sure it stays running and knows what to do when the lid is closed.  

To keep it from sleeping it's as simple as `Settings -> Power` and turn off `Automatic Suspend`.  Basically disable anything that reads as if it will put your machine to sleep.

Next I need to deal with what happens when I close the lid.  Unfortunately I don't see anything about that in Power settings so I need to edit the config file directly:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

And change the following value from the default to `ignore`:

```
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
```

If it is commented out (prefixed with `#`) then remove the `#` and save.  

That's it!  I can now take the machine, close the lid and set it up in a nice cool area with the external drives attached ready to run all the time.  Ideally you should plug it into your router directly with ethernet to minimize wifi issues, however the laptop I have unfortunately has no ethernet, so I'll need to settle for wifi.

## Creating the Project

Let's create a directory and initialize our Javascript project inside of it:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next we install the three dependency libraries for the project:

```bash
npm install cron rsync dotenv
```

Here's what each one is used for:

- **cron**: Will allow us to schedule the backup at specific intervals. This package uses a Javascript implementation of the _cron_ syntax and not the actual _cron_ daemon meaning we don't need to worry about OS compatibility issues with this package.

- **rsync**: This will handle the copying and syncing of files for us. This package _does_ use the actual `rsync` program installed on the user's machine so we will have to manage compatibility within our Node.js app for this one.

- **dotenv**: Allows us to read `.env` files from our project directory. This will let us include our personal directory paths and also our private Discord webhook without sharing that data in the git repo. Users who clone the project can provide their own values.

We'll create a Javascript file called `backup.js` and get the absolute basics working:

`backup.js`

```js
const CronJob = require("cron").CronJob;
const Rsync = require("rsync");

// Equivalent to writing `rsync -a example-source/ example-destination/` on terminal
rsync = new Rsync()
  // The -a flag means "archive" to say we are copying the full directory not just a file
  .flags("a")
  .source("example-source/")
  .destination("example-destination/");

const job = new CronJob(
  // Run this function once every minute
  // To learn more about this cron string visit the below link
  // https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_*_*
  "* * * * *",
  () => {
    rsync.execute((error, code, cmd) => {
      // List of rsync status codes
      // https://stackoverflow.com/a/20738063
      console.log("backup completed with status code: " + code);
    });
  },
  null,
  true,
  // Replace with your time zone
  // https://gist.github.com/diogocapela/12c6617fc87607d11fd62d2a4f42b02a
  "America/Toronto"
);

// Begin the cronjob
job.start();
```

Also create directories called `example-source` and `example-destination`.  Inside `example-source` create a TXT file inside called `sample-file.txt` with any content inside that file you like.  Doesn't matter what it is, it's just used to confirm our backup is working.

Here's what things look like before the script has been run (note the empty `example-destination` directory):

![Backup Before](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/r_20,bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640672226/blogs/node-backup/backup-before_q0ndw5.png)

After the script has run once:

![Backup After](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/r_20,bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640672226/blogs/node-backup/backup-after_licaio.png)

Things are looking good, we have a once-every-minute interval backup of our `example-source` directory to our `example-destination` directory. 

At this point you could replace those directory strings with whatever folders you like and create a regular directory backup system on your machine.

Let's make it easier to customize for those who are downloading and using our tool by adding `dotenv` package to read `.env` files as part of the configuration.

If you've already followed the tutorial you have the `dotenv` package installed with NPM so it's just a matter of importing it. Before we do let's create the `.env` file. Make sure to note that is `.env` with a starting `.` (to indicate hidden files):

`.env`

```env
SOURCE_DIR="example-source/"
DESTINATION_DIR="example-destination/"
CRON_STRING="* * * * *"
```

Now we can update our code to read from that file. We just have to `require` the `dotenv` package at the top of our code:

`backup.js`

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const CronJob = require("cron").CronJob;
const Rsync = require("rsync");

// Equivalent to writing `rsync -a example-source/ example-destination/` on terminal
rsync = new Rsync()
  // The -a flag means "archive" to say we are copying the full directory not just a file
  .flags("a")
  // Reads from the `.env` file in the project directory
  .source(process.env.SOURCE_DIR)
  .destination(process.env.DESTINATION_DIR);

const job = new CronJob(
  // Run this function once every minute
  // To learn more about this cron string visit the below link
  // https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_*_*
  process.env.CRON_STRING,
  () => {
    rsync.execute((error, code, cmd) => {
      // List of rsync status codes
      // https://stackoverflow.com/a/20738063
      console.log("backup completed with status code: " + code);
    });
  },
  null,
  true,
  // Replace with your time zone
  // https://gist.github.com/diogocapela/12c6617fc87607d11fd62d2a4f42b02a
  "America/Toronto"
);

// Begin the cronjob
job.start();
```

When we run `node backup.js` again we get the same result, but this time our source and destination directories are being read from the `.env` file. This will make it easier for users to add their own source/destination directories and cron string when they download the tool.

It also improves privacy as we will be adding `.env` to our `.gitignore` file so the directories that I choose to copy on my machine will not be included in the git repository for this project.

In fact, let's do that now. If you're creating this project for yourself you'll want to be able to commit it to your remote git host, so run:

```bash
git init
```

Then create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory with:

`.gitignore`

```gitignore
node_modules
.env
nohup.out
```

We exclude `.env` for reasons mentioned above, and `node_modules` since it will be re-created by running `npm install` for anyone who uses our project.  The last one `nohup.out` will contain some logs later in the tutorial that we don't need to share with others, so we're just adding it now in advance.

Excellent! You now have a great little tool that works on Linux and Mac... but what about Windows?

The truth is, basically all the development work I do is in a Linux environment. 

Even though I do all my daily development on Windows 11 with [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions) I'm still doing everything inside a native installing of Ubuntu despite logging into Windows each day.

I honestly don't even know how to use Windows `cmd` or PowerShell beyond the DOS commands I still remember from when I was a kid (dir?)... but if the majority of my personal stuff (photos and documents) are stored on Windows, maybe this is a good opportunity for me to learn?

I like learning new things! I challenge myself: what do I need to do to get this working on Windows?

Turns out it was surprisingly easy.

## Adding Cross Platform Support

Most of our app will work fine on Windows as-is, the big challenge here is [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync). 

As you can see from that link, `rsync` is a Unix copying tool that will be natively available on most Linux and mac environments; but not Windows.

The `rsync` package on NPM is simply a wrapper around the tool installed on your OS, so running our `backup.js` in PowerShell gives us an error. The error is that the `rsync` program does not exist.

Here's the really cool thing though: not only does Windows have a very _similar_ tool with a similar API called [robocopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy), the `rsync` NPM package allows us to chain a method called `executable()` that takes a string.

That string is the name of the copying tool we want to use.

It defaults to `rsync`, but we can provide it with any name we want.

We can check what OS the program is running on with `process.platform` which will return `win32` as a string when running on Windows.

Let's update `backup.js`:

`backup.js`

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const CronJob = require("cron").CronJob;
const Rsync = require("rsync");

// The value of process.platform will be:
// Windows: win32
// Mac: darwin
// Ubuntu: linux
const syncProgram = process.platform === "win32" ? "robocopy" : "rsync";

// Equivalent to writing `rsync -a example-source/ example-destination/` on terminal
rsync = new Rsync()
  .executable(syncProgram)
  // The -a flag means "archive" to say we are copying the full directory not just a file
  .flags("a")
  // Reads from the `.env` file in the project directory
  .source(process.env.SOURCE_DIR)
  .destination(process.env.DESTINATION_DIR);

const job = new CronJob(
  // Run this function once every minute
  // To learn more about this cron string visit the below link
  // https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_*_*
  process.env.CRON_STRING,
  () => {
    rsync.execute((error, code, cmd) => {
      let result;
      if (error) {
        // List of rsync status codes
        // https://stackoverflow.com/a/20738063
        result = `Code ${code} ${error?.message}`;
      } else {
        result = "Backup complete";
      }

      const currentDate = new Date().toISOString();
      // Write log to the console, or will be redirected to a
      // nohup.out file if using nohup
      process.stdout.write(`${currentDate}: ${result}\n`);
    });
  },
  null,
  true,
  // Replace with your time zone
  // https://gist.github.com/diogocapela/12c6617fc87607d11fd62d2a4f42b02a
  "America/Toronto"
);

// Begin the cronjob
job.start();
```

Notice the changes above. I did a check against `process.platform` and if it returns `win32` we set the executable copy program to `robocopy` instead of `rsync` which will allow it to run on Windows.

Lucky for us the syntax for `robocopy` is exactly the same as `rsync`:

```bash
robocopy <source> <destination>
```

This means we don't have to change anything else about the way our program already works, the `rsync` package will call `robocopy` exactly the same way when we're on Windows.

We're ready to try it out. In order to get the project files on Windows, I'm going to push them to Github and then clone them on by Windows filesystem.

So here's what I do: [I push this project to Github](https://github.com/alexeagleson/template-node-backup-directory). Then I open PowerShell.

_(I am a PowerShell noob, but I'm doing my best.)_

Turns out I don't even have `git` or `node` installed on Windows so I'm not going to get very far here. 

First I need to [download git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) so I can clone the project, then I need to [download node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) so I can run it.

Once downloaded and installed I can run both these commands in PowerShell and get valid output:

```
PS C:\Users\ME> git --version
git version 2.34.1.windows.1

PS C:\Users\ME> node --version
v16.13.1
```

Now that everything is set I can `git clone MY_PROJECT_URL` and then `cd` into that directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Before I can run the project though I need to create the `.env` file since I did not include it in the repo for privacy reasons:

`.env`

```env
SOURCE_DIR="example-source/"
DESTINATION_DIR="example-destination/"
CRON_STRING="* * * * *"
```

Finally now in PowerShell in the project directory i run:

```bash
node backup.js
```

And my result:

Before the script has been run on Windows (note the empty `example-destination` directory)

![Backup Before](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/r_20,bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640676104/blogs/node-backup/windows-backup-before_poxfzp.png)

After the script has run once on Windows:

![Backup After](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/r_20,bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640676104/blogs/node-backup/windows-backup-after_ziq2ck.png)

Note the status code doesn't necessarily match up with the `rsync` status codes, but the result is correct: the copying process was successful.

So that's really cool. You now have a tool that will copy the contents of one directory to another on an interval of your choice. Right now we have it setup to run every minute which is pretty overkill, but thanks to tools like [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) it's easy to create exactly the interval you want.

For example I only need to backup my directory once a week, so I'm going to set it to run [at 3am every Sunday](https://crontab.guru/#0_3_*_*_0).

We now have a backup process that runs on a schedule and works on Linux, Mac and Windows!

But... how are we going to keep this running all the time?

If we simply use `node backup.js` the process is going to stop as soon as we close our terminal. We need this process to be running in the background, ideally 24/7.

We are going to need a better solution. Enter `pm2`

## Running as a Background Process

Before we get into our final solution using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), I'd like to quickly show Mac/Linux users how you can get this to work _without_ installing any addition tools at all using [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup).

You can skip this section on `nohup` if you like and go right to the final solution using PM2 if you like, it's just here to give you a bit of a deeper insight on how to create background processes using native Unix tools.  

### Using nohup (Optional - Mac and Linux Only)

You can find out if you system supports `nohup` with:

```bash
nohup --version
```

```
$ nohup --version
nohup (GNU coreutils) 8.30
```

If you get a version number successfully, then this next step should work for you.

```bash
nohup node backup.js &
```

The leading `nohup` will tell your system that even when your session ends you don't want the process to stop, and the final trailing `&` symbol means to run it as a background [daemon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)>) process.

You will likely get an output that looks like:

```
[1] 7604
```

After running the command. This is the `process ID` of your node program. If for any reason you lose track of it you can find it again with this command:

```bash
pstree -p
```

You'll get output showing all the processes running on your system with their IDs. If you notice in the `backup.js` code example above we used `process.title` and gave it a string value of `node-backup-script`.

This helps find and identify the process ID when we use the `pstree -p` command:

![Pstree Output](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640679514/blogs/node-backup/pstree_clntnk.png)

Notice the `node-backup-sc(7604)` in there showing the same PID that we were given when the script started, and also the `title` value we set with `process.title` to make it easier to find and identify.

Since we can no longer simply `ctrl+C` to cancel the node script execution, we have to do something different. We have to kill the process by referencing the PID directly.

To do that you can run:

```bash
kill -9 YOUR_PID
```

Where `YOUR_PID` is the ID that is given on your machine. In my example above it's 7604. The `-9` tells it to override anything that might stop or intercept a system kill signal, you want to end the program no matter what.

So the `nohup` option will work will for Unix systems that support it as long as they are running 24/7, the process will keep running. There are a couple of issues with it though:

- If your program crashes, `nohup` will not reboot it
- This solution is Unix specific and will not work on Windows

So how do we create a solution that will run 24/7, will reboot on crash, and supports cross-platform? 

That's what [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is for.

### Using PM2 (All Platforms)

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

This command will work on any OS that has NPM installed (Linux, Mac or Windows). After installing you'll be able to verify it is available with:

```bash
pm2 --version
```

To begin the process just run:

```bash
pm2 start backup.js
```

![PM2 Start](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640680969/blogs/node-backup/pm2_thc0br.png)

So now the process is running in the background and will keep running even if you close your terminal, and will reboot on crash.

You can view the running process anytime with `pm2 list` and you can stop it with `pm2 stop backup` where "backup" is the name of the process.

You can also view the logs of your app by running  `pm2 logs backup`.  You'll get an output that looks like:

![PM2 Logs](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640739353/blogs/node-backup/pm2-logs_wrzsld.png)

Unfortunately this will not survive a full system reboot. Configuring `pm2` to start with your app automatically on reboot is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but there are very good instructions on how to handle it if you would like to do.

Here's for [Unix based systems](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/startup/) and [Windows](https://github.com/jessety/pm2-installer).

You can now keep this running on an old laptop, or on your own cloud server like a $5 monthly [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) for example.

Just be careful when looking at Node app hosting solutions, there are a lot of options out there, but the majority of free ones (Heroku for example) will put your app to "sleep" sometimes, which isn't a viable option as it must be awake when the scheduled backup triggers in order to work properly.

Lastly we'll add a little bonus tutorial showing how to use webhooks to send the status output of our backups to a Discord bot so that we can keep track of it easily.  

## Adding a Discord Webhook (Bonus)

Start by creating your webhook bot on your server.  Follow [this tutorial](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) up to the end of the section called **Making a Webhook**.  Stop when you get to **Quick Example: GitHub Webhook Integration**.  

All you need is to get to the point where you can click the button that says "Copy Webhook URL".  It will look like:

```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID
```

Where YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID is a long string of characters which may include additional slashes.  Basically everything after the `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/` you want to copy and paste into the `WEBHOOK_ID` key in your `.env` file.

`.env`

```
SOURCE_DIR="example-source/"
DESTINATION_DIR="example-destination/"
CRON_STRING="* * * * * *"
WEBHOOK_ID="YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID"
```

Next we'll update `backup.js`:

`backup.js`

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const CronJob = require("cron").CronJob;
const Rsync = require("rsync");
const https = require("https");

process.title = "node-backup-script";

// Will be true if there is a Discord WEBHOOK_ID set in the `.env` file
const useDiscord = !!process.env.WEBHOOK_ID;

const options = {
  hostname: "discord.com",
  path: `/api/webhooks/${process.env.WEBHOOK_ID}`,
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
};

// process.platform will be:
// Windows: win32
// Mac: darwin
// Ubuntu: linux
const syncProgram = process.platform === "win32" ? "robocopy" : "rsync";

// Equivalent to writing `rsync -a example-source/ example-destination/` on terminal
rsync = new Rsync()
  .executable(syncProgram)
  // The -a flag means "archive" to say we are copying the full directory not just a file
  .flags("a")
  // Reads from the `.env` file in the project directory
  .source(process.env.SOURCE_DIR)
  .destination(process.env.DESTINATION_DIR);

const job = new CronJob(
  // Run this function once every minute
  // To learn more about this cron string visit the below link
  // https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_*_*
  process.env.CRON_STRING,
  () => {
    rsync.execute((error, code, cmd) => {
      let result;
      if (error) {
        // List of rsync status codes
        // https://stackoverflow.com/a/20738063
        result = `Code ${code} ${error?.message}`;
      } else {
        result = "Backup complete";
      }

      const currentDate = new Date().toISOString();
      // Write log to the console, or will be redirected to a
      // nohup.out file if using nohup
      process.stdout.write(`${currentDate}: ${result}\n`);

      // Only sends the request if WEBHOOK_ID is defined
      if (useDiscord) {
        // Send the request to Discord with the configured options
        const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
          // do nothing with Discord response
        });

        // Discord requires a { content: string } shape for posting messages
        req.write(
          JSON.stringify({
            content: result,
          })
        );

        req.end();
      }
    });
  },
  null,
  true,
  // Replace with your time zone
  // https://gist.github.com/diogocapela/12c6617fc87607d11fd62d2a4f42b02a
  "America/Toronto"
);

// Begin the cronjob
job.start();

```

Presuming you set up your webhook bot correctly, you will see it post a message on your Discord channel with the status of the backup every time the cron job fires.  

![Discord Bot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640678608/blogs/node-backup/discord-bot_ebyx5w.png)

You can use this as a convenient way to see the log output without having to log into your server and check manually.  If there is an error, the Discord bot will print the error message.  For example if I change the source to a folder that does not exist:

![Discord Bot Error](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqse2txyi/image/upload/bo_2px_solid_darkgrey/v1640738833/blogs/node-backup/discord-bot-error_newy9m.png)


I can lookup the [status code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20738063) to get more information about the problem.

So we've now handled all of the major features required for this project!

- Creating a backup of one directory to another
- Support for scheduled times of backups
- Cross platform support
- Communication of success/error (either through PM2 logs or Discord)

## Wrapping Up

I hope you learned something new from this tutorial, I know it was kind of a hodge-podge of different concepts, but that was a big part of the idea.  One of my favourite ways of learning new things is to connect existing skills and tools in interesting ways.
